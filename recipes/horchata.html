    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Horchata is a delicious rice (or coconut) based drink that you can find at most Mexican restaurants in the United States and abroad.
        The reason it is so popular is that it always adds a refreshing touch to any meal. I have yet to meet someone that has tried it without falling in love and being disappointed when it is gone.
        Today, I want to show you how to make a truly authentic version of horchata that I learned growing up in Mexico. It will take some patience and a little bit of preparation, but I assure you that the results will be worth it. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup White Rice</li>
        <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Almonds, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Cinnamon Stick</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Vanilla</li>
        <li>12 oz Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>1.5 cups Milk</li>
        <li>1 liter Water</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by soaking the rice, cinnamon, and almonds in a bowl of water all night, or at least for 5 hours so that the rice softens slightly.</li>
        <li>Strain the water from the cinnamon, rice, and almond mixture that were soaking, disposing of water.</li>
        <li>Blend the cinnamon, rice, and almond mixture with evaporated milk until a smoother mix is formed and the grains of rice are completely ground.</li>
        <li>Strain the resulting liquid into a pitcher, and add the sugar, vanilla, and milk. Mix well until everything is well combined.Add a liter of water, and serve with ice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
